            "detail": """Morning sickness is nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. It's a common condition affecting up to 70% of women in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). Despite its name, "morning" sickness can happen at any time of the day. There are various at-home treatments for morning sickness, including diet and lifestyle changes. Some obstetricians recommend over-the-counter (OTC) medications for nausea. Symptoms tend to improve by the second trimester (beginning at 14 weeks).\n\n<h4>How soon can morning sickness start?</h4>\n\nIt starts as early as the sixth week of pregnancy, but the exact timing varies. Most women experience signs of morning sickness before nine weeks of pregnancy.\n\n<h4>Can morning sickness become severe?</h4>\n\n Yes. Most women with morning sickness feel nauseous for a short time each day and may vomit once or twice. In more severe cases of morning sickness, nausea can last several hours each day and vomiting occurs more than four times per day. This is a condition called hyperemesis gravidarum.\n\n<h4>When does morning sickness peak?</h4>\n\nMorning sickness feels the worst for most women around eight to 10 weeks of pregnancy. However, this time varies, and not everyone's symptoms \"peak\" at the same time.\n\n<h4>How long does morning sickness last?</h4>\n\nMorning sickness tends to improve or go away around the 13th week of pregnancy (the end of the first trimester). However, some women experience lingering symptoms through the beginning of the second trimester (weeks 14 to 27 in pregnancy). In rare cases, morning sickness occurs until the end of your pregnancy.\n\n<h4>Management strategies include:</h4>\n\n• Eating small, frequent meals to avoid an empty stomach\n\n• Consuming bland, easy-to-digest foods like crackers, especially before getting out of bed\n\n• Avoiding strong food odors, greasy foods, and spicy foods\n\n• Drinking fluids between meals rather than with food\n\n• Trying ginger in various forms (tea, candies, capsules)\n\n• Taking vitamin B6 supplements (with provider approval)\n\n• Using acupressure wristbands designed for motion sickness\n\n• Getting adequate rest and managing stress\n\n<h4>Does morning sickness harm my baby?</h4>\n\nMild to moderate nausea and vomiting during pregnancy usually isn’t harmful to you or the fetus. However, it can become a problem if you can’t keep food or liquid down, become dehydrated and lose weight. Unmanaged severe nausea and vomiting can prevent you from getting the nutrition you need and affect your baby’s weight at birth.\n\n<h4>When to seek medical help:</h4>\n\n• If you can't keep any food or fluids down for 24 hours\n\n• If you're losing weight\n\n• If you experience signs of dehydration (dark urine, dizziness, dry mouth)\n\n• If vomiting is severe or contains blood\n\nFor severe cases, your healthcare provider may diagnose hyperemesis gravidarum (extreme, persistent nausea and vomiting) and recommend prescription medications or occasionally hospitalization for IV fluids and nutrition."""

            "detail":"""<h4>Is it common to be so tired in the first trimester of pregnancy?</h4>\n\nFeeling super tired, don't have the energy to do much of anything, and craving your bed? For many people, the extreme tiredness (fatigue) of the first trimester is quite a surprise. And it’s an especially hard transition for those who are normally go-getters with lots of energy. People who usually need only 6 hours of sleep at night often find they need nearly double that during these first weeks of pregnancy. And for others, daytime tiredness is paired with trouble sleeping deeply. Or having trouble sleeping for more than a few hours at night. Nausea and vomiting can also be a big drain on your energy.\n\n<h4>What causes the fatigue?</h4>\n\nFortunately, this is normal. It’s a signal from your body to slow down. And to give it time to adjust to the incredible changes happening inside. Hormone changes play a big role in making you feel tired, especially the hormone progesterone. This hormone rises sharply in the first trimester. In addition, your blood volume increases to supply the developing placenta and fetal circulation. This makes your heart pump faster and stronger. This results in faster pulse and breathing rates. Low iron levels can sometimes make you tired too. But this is more common later in pregnancy.\n\n<h4>How long will the fatigue last?</h4>\n\nFor most people, the extreme fatigue of the first trimester is soon forgotten. That's because the second trimester often comes with a glow and a boost in energy. So don't worry if it seems like all you’re doing these first few weeks is lying around, dozing, or napping. This is normal. Fatigue often returns in the third trimester. This is because of disrupted sleep and increasing discomforts. But this will also get better over time.\n\n<h4>What can you do to feel better?</h4>\n\n•**Eat well**:Good nutrition and eating small, frequent, healthy meals can help. This can keep you going. It can also help with nausea.\n\n•**take a break at work**:You may feel sleepy at work. If so, try some stretches or deep breathing exercises. Or get up and walk around the office. Or take a break outside.\n\n•**Go for a walk**:When you can, go for a brisk walk around the block. A little exercise can give you energy. And it may help you rest better when you do get to sleep.\n\n•**change your sleep habits**:Take naps, if possible, during the day. You may also want to try going to bed earlier.\n\n•**Drink enough fluids during the day**:And drink very little starting a few hours before bedtime. This may help prevent you from having to get up to pee (urinate) at night.\n\n<h4>What should you stay away from?</h4>\n\nDon't give in to the urge to drink coffee or other caffeinated drinks to stay alert. The caffeine really isn’t good for your developing baby. Instead, drink plenty of water.\n\nIt's easy to feel guilty about not being able to do everything like you’re used to. It's OK to pamper yourself. By reducing any extra job or social commitments during these first few weeks, you can be as productive as possible in your regular responsibilities. """

            "detail":"""<h4>Why breast pain occurs in early pregnancy</h4>\n\nBreast pain is often the first symptom of pregnancy, occurring as early as one to two weeksTrusted Source after conception — technically, weeks three and four of pregnancy. That sore boob sensation peaks in the first trimester because your body is flooding with hormones. These hormones have an important job, preparing your body to grow a tiny human — a hungry little human.\n\nTo feed that hunger, hormones work quickly to prepare your breasts for breastfeeding. Blood flow to the area increases and your boobs grow larger. The cleavage may be pretty great — but this growth can also be painful, even causing skin irritation and itching. Ouch!\n\nThe milk ducts in your breasts also grow to prepare for breastfeeding. And hormones stimulate the growth of milk-producing glands. Basically, your boobs go through a massive growth spurt.\n\n<h4>Other breast changes in pregnancy</h4>\n\nPain is not the only breast-related symptom you can expect during your pregnancy. During your first trimester, you may also notice blue veins pumping extra blood into your breasts and changes to the size or shape of your nipples.\n\nDuring your second trimester (weeks 13–26), you may notice that your areolas — the pigmented areas around your nipples — have grown darker. And they’ll continue darkening throughout the second and third trimesters , too.\n\nYou may also notice tiny bumps on the areolas and wonder what is going on — but again, this is completely normal. These are called Montgomery’s tubercles. They’re oil-producing glands that lubricate the breasts during breastfeeding and make the process a little more comfortable for you and your little one!\n\nDuring the second and third trimesters you may also begin leaking a yellowish fluid called colostrum. This can be a little disconcerting, but don’t worry! This is the good stuff. Colostrum is an immune-boosting fluid that your baby will drink in the days following delivery, before your milk comes in. This super nutritious fluid is sometimes called “liquid gold” because it’s so good for your baby!\n\nNipple discharge can happen anytime, but it’s particularly common during nipple stimulation. Nipple discharge can vary in color from creamy white to, yellow, green, or brown (might want to warn your partner about that one).\n\nBloody nipple discharge can also happen during pregnancy. Usually, it is the result of growing milk ducts, but sometimes it can be a sign of a blocked duct.\n\n<h4>Should I be concerned?</h4>\n\nSore boobs during pregnancy — or before or during your period, for that matter — is very common and generally nothing to worry about. And if your breast pain goes away after your first trimester, awesome! That’s also totally normal and will definitely come as a relief. Like morning sickness, some symptoms do go away once you’re farther along.\n\nWhat is concerning is feeling a new or growing lump. Benign (harmless) lumps can pop up during pregnancy, so try not to freak out, but definitely get to the doctor ASAP.\n\nAbout 1 in every 1,000 pregnant women develop breast cancer. This can put the health of you and your baby at serious risk."""

While a pregnant person can experience frequent urination due to hormonal changes, they should consult their doctor if they experience pain while urinating or other symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI).\n\nWhile some pregnant people may experience mild changes, others may feel the need to continuously run to the bathroom throughout the day and night.Frequency can also reappear later in the pregnancy as the uterus and baby continue to grow, creating pressure on the bladder.\n\nPregnant people who have a fever or chills, or notice a burning sensation while urinating, should seek immediate medical attention as it could be a urinary tract infection (UTI). Other symptoms may include back pain or a sharp increase in the need to urinate in a small period of time.\n\n<h4>Symptoms </h4>\n\nAlthough symptoms may vary from person to person, many pregnant people notice they begin to need to urinate more frequently during their first trimester (week 1 to week 12). Some people may also experience leakage or stress urinary incontinence (SUI) while pregnant as the fetus grows and presses down on the bladder, urethra, and pelvic floor muscles.\n\nThe Office on Women’s Health notes that leakage may occur when:\n\n• sneezing\n\n• coughing\n\n• laughing\n\n• exercising\n\n• lifting something\n\n• walking\n\n<h4>What to do about it</h4>\n\nPelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises, can strengthen the muscles of the pelvis and urethra and support the bladder. Performing Kegel exercises during pregnancy may help some people regain control over their urine flow.Kegel exercises are safe to perform during pregnancy and after childbirth.\n\nTo perform Kegel exercises, empty the bladder and then follow these steps:\n\n1.Relax the abdomen, chest, thighs, and buttocks.\n\n2.Tighten the pelvic floor muscles and hold for 5 to 10 seconds.\n\n3.Relax the muscles for 5 to 10 seconds.\n\n4.Repeat 10 times.\n\n<h4>When to talk to a doctor</h4>\n\nFrequent urination is a normal pregnancy symptom. However, it also can be a sign of an underlying condition that may require medical treatment.
             Pregnant people who show additional symptoms of a UTI, including painful urination, should contact their doctor as soon as possible."""

You are not alone; mood swings during pregnancy are common. You may be excited about being pregnant, but you can also be stressed or overwhelmed. You may have constant worries that contribute to your mood swings.\n\n<h4>Questions such as:</h4>\n\n--Will I be a good parent?\n\n--How am I going to manage financially?\n\n--Will my baby be healthy?\n\n--Am I doing the right things to prepare for my baby?\n\nPregnancy is a life-changing event full of physical and emotional changes. Understanding these changes will help you have a positive experience. It may prove helpful to talk through these changes and worries with a professional.\n\n<h3>What causes pregnancy mood swings?</h3>\n\nMood changes during pregnancy can be caused by physical stresses, fatigue, changes in your metabolism, or by the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Significant changes in your hormone levels can affect your level of neurotransmitters, which are brain chemicals that regulate mood. Mood swings are mostly experienced during the first trimester between 6 to 10 weeks and then again in the third trimester as your body prepares for birth.\n\n<h3>What should I do to treat my mood swings?</h3>\n\nIt is important to understand you are not alone; mood swings are just another aspect of the pregnancy experience. 
            Knowing that what you are experiencing is normal and somewhat expected may help you cope.\n\n**The following list includes ways to manage your stress level:**\n\nGet plenty of sleep\n\n--Take a break during the day to relax\n\n--Get regular physical activity\n\n--Eat well\n\n--Spend time with your partner\n\n--Take a nap.\n\n--Go for a walk\n\n--See a movie with a friend\n\n--Don’t be so hard on yourself\n\n--Try pregnancy yoga class or meditation\n\n--Get a massage\n\n<h3>When should I seek professional help?</h3>\n\nIf your mood swings last more than two weeks and do not seem to get better, you may want to ask your health care provider for a referral to a counselor. More than 11 million American women are affected by depression each year. Depression is most prevalent in women during childbearing years but can occur at any age.\n\n**Some symptoms of depression include:**\n\n--Recurrent anxiety and increased irritability
            \n\n--Sleep disturbances\n\n--Change in eating habits\n\n--Inability to concentrate on anything for very long\n\n--Short-term memory loss\n\nif your mood swings become more frequent and intense, it is crucial that you speak with your health care provider about options for dealing with severe mood swings, anxiety or depression."""

We speak to a nutritionist to uncover everything you need to know.\n\n<h4>When do pregnancy cravings start?</h4>\n\nIf you’ve just found out you’re pregnant, or you’re expecting but haven’t experienced any specific hankerings yet, you might be wondering if pregnancy cravings are likely to kick in.\n\n“Cravings can occur at any point during pregnancy,” explains Fiuza. “Typically, they tend to start at the end of the first trimester and intensify during the second trimester.” For some women, pregnancy food cravings could start as early as five weeks into pregnancy. \n\n<h4>How common are pregnancy cravings?</h4>\n\nIf you’re experiencing pregnancy food cravings, then you’re now part of a very large club, as pregnancy cravings are extremely common. In fact, Fiuza says that anywhere between 50% to 90% of pregnant people in the United States will experience them.\n\n<h4>Sweet cravings during pregnancy</h4>\n\n it’s OK to indulge your sweet cravings during pregnancy, it’s recommended that you don’t reach for sweets too often and that you only do so as part of a healthy diet.\n\n<h4>Fruit cravings during pregnancy</h4>\n\nIf you have fruit cravings during pregnancy, then that’s great, as this is a delicious and healthy snack to enjoy throughout your pregnancy and beyond. If you’re craving fruit, you could try making a delicious fruit smoothie or grab an orange to satisfy your cravings.\n\n<h4>Carbohydrate cravings during pregnancy</h4>\n\nPregnancy cravings for carbohydrates such as bread, cereal, and crackers are also common. If you find yourself craving these, Fiuza recommends opting for healthier, whole grain varieties that contain more nutrients, like fiber and vitamins, instead of processed varieties that may have added sugar, fats, and salt.\n\n<h4>Fast food cravings during pregnancy</h4>\n\nDoes a gooey slice of pizza or a plate of salty, crispy chips sound particularly delicious right now? This could be due to pregnancy cravings, with both the aforementioned blog post study and Fiuza naming pizza and chips as two of the most commonly craved junk foods during pregnancy. As with sweets, it’s OK to indulge these cravings occasionally, but try to eat them as part of a healthy, balanced diet.\n\n<h4>Dairy cravings during pregnancy</h4>\n\nDairy cravings during pregnancy, such as a craving for milk, are also common. The good news is that this is generally a healthy craving, too. This is because dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese all contain calcium, a mineral that helps the fetus to develop healthy bones and teeth and helps to keep your own bones and teeth healthy and strong. \n\n<h4>Spicy food cravings during pregnancy</h4>\n\nf all you can think about is ordering the spiciest takeout you can find, then yes, you guessed it; you could be experiencing a pregnancy food craving. Spicy cravings in pregnancy are also normal, so if you suddenly find yourself wanting to order a spicy curry when previously your go-to was something milder, then don’t worry.\n\n<h4>Pickle cravings during pregnancy</h4>\n\nPickles are a classic pregnancy food craving, and again, it’s generally OK to indulge it. It is absolutely fine to satisfy your pickle craving, but be mindful of quantities, as too much salt can worsen water retention in pregnancy and increase the risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, which may have negative health effects for your baby."""

Some reasons for bleeding are serious, while others aren’t. Contact your healthcare provider and share your symptoms. They can determine if you need an appointment or tests to check for pregnancy complications.\n\n<h4>Why am I bleeding during pregnancy?</h4>\n\nIt’s common to have bleeding or spotting (light bleeding) during pregnancy. This is especially true in the first trimester. Bleeding during pregnancy can happen for many reasons. It doesn’t mean something is wrong or that you should panic. But it could be a sign of something more serious. That’s why it’s always a good idea to contact your pregnancy care provider if you have vaginal bleeding at any time during pregnancy. They’re the best person to determine if the bleeding is normal or if you need further tests. In the meantime, try to stay calm until you talk to your provider. Many people who experience bleeding during pregnancy have healthy pregnancies and deliver healthy babies.\n\n<h4>Bleeding vs. spotting in pregnancy</h4>\n\nSpotting is when you notice a few drops of pink, red or dark brown blood. You see it in your underwear or on toilet paper when you wipe. If you put a panty liner on, the blood won’t fill it. Spotting during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, is usually not concerning.\n\nBleeding describes a flow of blood that’s greater than a drop here and there. The amount of blood requires you to wear a pad or panty liner to keep it from ruining your underwear.\n\nYou should call your pregnancy care provider either way and tell them about it. They may want to schedule an appointment to confirm everything is OK.\n\n<h4>What are the most common causes of bleeding in the first trimester?</h4>\n\nBleeding or spotting in the first trimester is common. Between 15% and 25% of all pregnant women experience bleeding or spotting in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Even though it’s common, you should still call your healthcare provider to let them know.\n\nSome causes of bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy are:\n\n1.**Implantation bleeding:** This is when the fertilized egg implants in the wall of your uterus and causes light bleeding.\n\n2.**Hormonal changes:** The extra hormones you need for pregnancy can sometimes lead to spotting.\n\n3.**Changes to your cervix:** Your cervix may be more sensitive as it changes and prepares for pregnancy. This could lead to bleeding more easily.\n\n4.**Ectopic pregnancy:** When a pregnancy forms outside of your uterus (like in your fallopian tubes). It can be life-threatening without treatment.\n\n5.**Molar pregnancy:** A rare condition when a fertilized egg implants in your uterus, but a tumor forms instead of a fetus."""

Constipation occurs when there is abdominal pain or discomfort, difficult and infrequent bowel movements, and the passage of hard stools.\n\n<h4>What causes constipation during pregnancy?</h4>\n\nIn general, worry, anxiety, minimal physical exercise, and a low-fiber diet may cause constipation. Constipation during pregnancy is due to the increase in progesterone hormones that relax the intestinal muscle causing food and waste to move slower through your system.\n\nSometimes iron tablets may contribute to constipation. Make sure you are drinking plenty of water if you are taking iron supplements. You may need to switch to a different type of iron tablet, but it is important to talk to your healthcare provider first.\n\n<h4>How can I prevent or treat constipation during pregnancy?</h4>\n\nHere are a few things that you can do to help prevent constipation from occurring or treat it if you are already experiencing it:\n\n**Eat a high fiber diet:**Ideally, you will consume 25 to 30 grams per day of dietary fiber from fruits, vegetables, breakfast cereals, whole-grain bread, prunes, and bran. This helps ensure bulkier stools that are easier to poop.\n\n**Drink a lot of fluids:**Drinking plenty of fluids is important, particularly when increasing fiber intake helps ensure softer stools. Drink 10 to 12 cups of fluids each day. It is the combination of a high fiber diet and plenty of liquids that best help you eliminate your waste. Sweat, hot/humid climates, and exercise may increase your need for additional fluids.\n\n**Exercise routinely:**If you are inactive, you have a greater chance of constipation. Walking, swimming and other moderate exercises will help the intestines work by stimulating your bowels. Schedule exercise three times a week for 20-30 minutes each.\n\n**Over-the-counter remedies:**There are over-the-counter products such as Metamucil (Category B) which may help soften your bowel movements and reduce constipation. Always speak to your health care provider before using over-the-counter medications.\n\n**Reduce or eliminate iron supplements:**Iron supplements may contribute to constipation. Good nutrition can often meet your iron needs during pregnancy. Taking smaller doses of iron throughout the day rather than taking it all at once can reduce constipation. Talk to your healthcare provider about checking your iron levels and recommendations to manage iron intake during pregnancy. Find natural ways to get iron here."""

However, if these feelings are persistent and strong enough to interfere with your daily life, this may be an anxiety disorder, a type of mood disorder.\n\nFeeling anxious while pregnant is completely normal. It’s natural to worry about whether your baby is healthy, have fears about being a good parent, or stress about how your relationship with your partner will change. The changes in your hormone levels that come with pregnancy can also affect your mood and emotions, making you more prone to worry and stress.\n\n<h4>How Often Does Anxiety During Pregnancy Happen?</h4>\n\nAntenatal anxiety is a very common experience. More than 1 in 10 women experience anxiety at some point during their pregnancy.\n\n<h4>What Are Some Symptoms of Anxiety During Pregnancy?</h4>\n\nSince there are different types of anxiety disorders, the symptoms vary.

It involves trophoblasts that are cells that grow abnormally. Usually, these cells develop into the organ that provides nourishment to the developing fetus. The placenta is another name for that organ.\n\nComplete and partial molar pregnancies are the two types of molar pregnancy. The placental tissue swells and seems to develop fluid-filled cysts during a full molar pregnancy. No fetus is present.\n\nBoth normal and irregular tissue may be present in the placenta during a partial molar pregnancy. A fetus might exist, but it is incapable of surviving. Miscarriages of the fetus typically occur early in pregnancy. Serious side effects, such as an uncommon type of cancer, can arise from a molar pregnancy. Early treatment is necessary for a molar pregnancy.\n\n<h4>Symptoms of Molar Pregnancy</h4>\n\nSometimes, a molar pregnancy has no symptoms, but signs can include:\n\n•Vaginal bleeding in the first trimester\n\n•Brown watery discharge\n\n•Grape-like sacs passing from the vagina\n\n•More frequent or severe nausea and vomiting than typical for pregnancy\n\n•Pelvic pressure or discomfort\n\n•Excessive abdominal swelling for the stage of pregnancy\n\n•High blood pressure (preeclampsia) before 20 weeks\n\n•Anemia (low red blood cell count)\n\n•Extremely elevated levels of hCG hormone\n\n•Ovarian cysts\n\n<h4>Risks and Complications of Molar Pregnancy</h4>\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nMaternal age, with a larger chance in those under 15 or over 43, and a history of molar pregnancies, which increases the risk to roughly 1 in 100, are factors that can contribute to molar pregnancy.\n\n**Complications**:\n\nComplete molar pregnancies are more likely to result in persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), which can arise if molar tissue persists and grows after excision. Vaginal bleeding may result from high hCG levels, which post-removal signifies GTN. Chemotherapy and, in extreme situations, hysterectomy are available as forms of treatment. Rarely, choriocarcinoma, a malignant GTN type that is usually curable with chemotherapy, may arise and spread.\n\n<h4>Treatment Options for Molar Pregnancy</h4>\n\nTo avoid difficulties, the abnormal tissue in the uterus is removed as part of the treatment for molar pregnancy. This is typically accomplished by carefully removing the tissue using a process known as dilatation and curettage (D&C). Medication may be utilised in certain situations to aid in the tissue’s expulsion. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels must be regularly checked after therapy to make sure no molar tissue is left behind and to identify any ongoing growth. Chemotherapy frequently works if persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) develops. A hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus, may be considered for full therapy in rare, severe situations."""

While they pose no risk at all to mother or baby, the discomfort created if they lead to itching, not to mention the cosmetic effects of their appearance, can cause pregnant women much distress.<h4>What causes pregnancy stretch marks?</h4>\n\nInterestingly, the cause of pregnancy stretch marks (or striae gravidarum) comes down to two factors, one of which is unique to pregnancy. Firstly, there is the physical stretch of the skin that occurs in pregnancy (and in other periods of rapid weight gain such as adolescence).
            While the skin adapts to continuous movement by expanding and contracting, during these periods the skin has insufficient time to adjust. As the body expands faster than the skin covering it, the skin tears. The resulting scar that forms from this tear is what we know as a stretch mark.\n\nThe second factor, which is still a subject of debate among experts, involves the priming of the skin by increased levels of hormones in pregnancy. Together, these hormones attract more water into the skin, which relaxes the bonds between collagen fibers. This makes it easier for the skin to tear when it is stretched and for stretch marks to form.\n\n<h4>When and where do they form?</h4>\n\nWhile stretch marks generally become visible during the later trimesters of pregnancy (around the sixth or seventh month), some women will start to see them forming as soon as their bellies start growing. Most lighter-skinned women tend to develop pinkish stretch marks, whereas darker-skinned women tend to have stretch marks that are lighter than the surrounding skin. Their pattern of development follows three stages.\n\n<h4>Stages of stretch marks during pregnancy</h4>\n\n•Stage 1: Early stretch marks will appear pink in color, and may also be itchy. The skin immediately around the stretch marks may also look ‘flattened’ and ‘thin’.\n\n•Stage 2: Gradually, the stretch marks will enlarge in length and width and become a reddish or purple color.\n\n•Stage 3: Once the stretch marks have matured, they lose their reddish/pink hue. In the months after pregnancy, they will start to fade and become pale white or silver. They may also appear slightly depressed and irregular in shape or length.\n\n<h4>How can I prevent stretch marks?</h4>\n\n<h4>Skin Food</h4>\n\n•Collagen and elastin fibers in the skin are necessary to keep rapidly growing skin taut, and the stronger they are, the less likely they are to break and leave resulting stretch marks. It, therefore, makes sense to eat foods that are rich in Vitamin E and C, zinc and silica, which help to form collagen. Vitamin C, in particular, is an important antioxidant that helps protect tissue from damage. Vitamins B2 (Riboflavin) and B3 (Niacin) are also said to help promote and maintain healthy skin.
            Drinking sufficient water (approximately 2 liters a day) is essential in order to help strengthen and renew your skin.<h4>Exercise</h4>\n\n•In addition to boosting energy levels, reducing **mood swings**, improving sleep patterns and enhancing one’s overall self-image, **exercise** too can help prevent stretch marks. Exercise improves circulation, which keeps the skin elastic and more able to stretch as it grows. This improved circulation also reduces the possibility of varicose veins and swollen ankles in pregnancy.<h4>Keeping skin supple</h4>\n\n•In addition to ensuring that you keep your skin supple through eating the right foods and getting enough exercise, you should use a topically-applied product like Bio-Oil that is specifically formulated to maximize the skin’s elasticity. By applying Bio-Oil twice daily from the first trimester throughout pregnancy, your skin will remain well-hydrated and better able to stretch.\n\n"""

This position may also relieve stress.\n\n•**Stay active**: If you sit a lot during the day, get up and walk around every couple of hours. Movement helps increase overall blood flow.<h4>Tips to Treat Leg Cramps at Home</h4>\n\n•Massage the cramping muscle and nearby muscle groups to release the tightened muscles to restore proper blood flow, oxygen and nutrients to the muscle.\n\n•Gently hold your leg in a stretched position until the cramp stops. This lengthens your muscle fibers so they can properly contract and tighten, allowing your muscle’s oxygen supply to be restored.\n\n•Rotate applying ice, to ease the pain of the cramp, and heat, to relax your muscle and increase blood flow.<h4>When to See a Doctor</h4>\n\nIf leg cramps are keeping you awake at night and at-home treatments aren't working, **talk with your doctor or midwife**.

Varicose veins often start in the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nVaricose veins are blood vessels that have collected too much blood. They look blue and swollen. Up to 4 in 10 people who are pregnant get varicose veins. Varicose veins often start in the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nVaricose veins develop when these one-way valves don't work as well as they should. This means that your blood flows back down your legs and pools in your veins. This stretches the vein walls and causes the veins to swell, twist and bulge. If they become large enough, you can see them under your skin.<h4>Why do I get varicose veins during pregnancy?</h4>\n\nPregnancy increases your chances of developing varicose veins for 3 main reasons:\n\n•Throughout pregnancy, you produce more blood than usual. This increases the pressure in your veins.\n\n•As your baby grows, your uterus gets bigger and presses on the veins that return blood from your legs to your heart.\n\n•Your pregnancy hormones make the walls of your veins softer, and more likely to bulge.\n\nBecause of these effects, varicose veins can develop or get worse during pregnancy. Your risk goes up the older you are and the more full-term pregnancies you’ve had. You’re also more likely to get varicose veins if they run in your family.<h4>Where could I get varicose veins?</h4>\n\nVaricose veins mainly develop in your legs. However, you can also get them in your vulva (the area at the opening of your vagina) or rectum (back passage). Varicose veins of the rectum are also known as **haemorrhoids**.<h4>Are varicose veins painful?</h4>\n\nVaricose veins can cause aches and pains in your legs. Your legs might feel heavy or restless, and they might throb, burn or **cramp**. Some people find varicose veins are not painful and give them no problems.\n\nYou'll probably find that your symptoms are worse later in the day because you've been standing for longer. By the next morning, you'll usually feel better because you've been lying down and the pressure on your veins has eased.<h4>Do varicose veins increase my risk of other health problems?</h4>\n\nIf you have varicose veins, you’re at higher risk of developing a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). If you’re already at risk of DVT for other reasons, you might need treatment to prevent it. You can discuss this with your doctor or midwife.<h4>Can I do anything to prevent varicose veins?</h4>\n\n**Exercise** helps your circulation generally. Specific exercises like calf raises and walking on the spot are good for helping blood flow in your legs.\n\n•do ankle exercises to get your circulation going — bend each foot up and down and rotate it in circles\n\n•shift your weight from foot to foot regularly while you’re standing\n\n•avoid wearing anything tight around your waist or thighs\n\n•put your legs up (for example, on a foot stool or another chair) when you’re resting or sitting"""

                "detail":"""Chances are good that you’re one of many pregnant people who experience the churning and burning of heartburn or acid indigestion. It typically hits somewhere in the second or third trimester, and it can be miserable. Heartburn doesn’t really mean your heart is burning.\n\nBut it’s a good description of the discomfort that begins behind the breastbone. It then moves up to the neck and throat. Officially, heartburn is known as gastroesophageal reflux, when acidic stomach juices or food and fluids back up into the esophagus. This is a hollow muscular tube between your mouth and your stomach.<h4>Why does it happen in pregnancy</h4>\n\nMany people who have heartburn during pregnancy have never had problems before. Unfortunately, if you had heartburn before becoming pregnant, you’re more likely to have symptoms while you are pregnant.\n\nAlthough the exact reasons aren’t clear, most experts believe that pregnancy hormones, particularly progesterone, play a role. Hormones cause relaxation of the esophageal sphincter. This is a tight circular band of muscle at the top of the stomach.\n\nThis allows partly digested food and stomach acids to backflow, or reflux, into the esophagus. In addition, progesterone also slows the digestive process. This keeps food in the stomach longer. The pregnancy itself—the upward pressure of the growing uterus—also may play a role.<h4>What makes it worse?</h4>\n\nMost spicy, greasy, fatty foods known for causing heartburn are also likely to cause problems for pregnant people. Food doesn’t digest as well or move as quickly during pregnancy. So, eating large meals or overeating in general can also increase the risk for heartburn. Eating right before bedtime can cause problems, too. Smoking makes heartburn worse and is another reason to quit, especially while pregnant.<h4>What makes it better?</h4>\n\nFor most people, things that help reduce acid production or prevent reﬂux are helpful in preventing the discomfort of heartburn. Here are tips that may help:\n\n•Don't eat classic spicy foods, as well as those with lots of fat or grease. Many people advise not having citrus and chocolate, as well.\n\n•Eat multiple, small meals spread during the day, much like grazing, instead of 3 big meals.\n\n•Try raising the head of your bed by several inches. And wait a while after eating before going to bed or lying down.\n\nIf your symptoms don't improve after the above advised diet and lifestyle changes are in place, talk with your healthcare provider about over-the-counter medicines. Antacids are available as chewable tablets and liquids. They work by coating the lining of the esophagus and stomach and neutralizing stomach acid. Heartburn medicines called H2-blockers work by reducing the amount of acid made by your stomach. Although most of these are considered safe in pregnancy, as with all medicines, stay away from these in the first trimester.<h4>When will it end</h4>\n\nHeartburn symptoms are often mild and manageable. Tell your healthcare provider if your heartburn is severe, if you spit up blood, or have dark-colored bowel movements. This is a sign of blood in your digestive tract. Fortunately, heartburn often ends with the birth of your baby and your body goes back to its nonpregnant state."""

Here are some tips:\n\n•Eat smaller meals more often and eat slowly.\n\n•Avoid eating for 2 or 3 hours before exercising or going to bed.\n\n•Avoid eating and drinking at the same time, which can make your stomach fuller.\n\n•sit up straight while eating and don't lie down right after a meal.\n\n•Raise the head of your bed or sleep on at least 2 pillows. Sleeping on your left side may also help.<h4>Can I take medication to treat indigestion?</h4>\n\nAntacids can relieve your symptoms quickly. They are safe in pregnancy if you don't take more than the recommended dose. There are many different types. Talk to your pharmacist to find one that's most suitable for you.\n\nIf antacids don't help, your doctor can prescribe other medicines that are safe for use during pregnancy.\n\nIf changing how you eat doesn't improve your heartburn, your **doctor or midwife** may suggest that you take medicine for it."""

You may see changes such as a sudden **glow** on your face or pinkish, reddish streaks on your stomach. Not every pregnant woman will experience all the same skin changes.<h4>Common Skin Changes During Pregnancy</h4>\n\n**Stretch marks:** The average woman gains about 30 lbs over the nine months of pregnancy. That means your belly skin will stretch to accommodate your baby bump and that can lead to stretch marks. Almost 90% of pregnant women will experience stretch marks which appear as pinkish or reddish streaks running down your abdomen and/or breasts.\n\n**Exercising:** hydration and lotions that contain vitamin E and alpha-hydroxy acids have been said to help in the prevention of stretch marks. These remedies have not been medically proven to have a direct effect on stretch marks, but it never hurts to try. If you find that nothing is working for you, take comfort in knowing that these streaks will fade to silvery faint lines after delivery.\n\n**Line Nigra** is a darkened vertical line in the middle of a pregnant belly. It’s a natural part of pregnancy so there is nothing you can do to prevent this pregnancy line. The good news is it usually fades shortly after delivery.<h4>Pregnancy Glow</h4>\n\nWhen you are pregnant your body produces 50% more blood, resulting in more blood circulation through your body.  This increase in blood circulation causes your face to be brighter.\n\nYour body is also producing a fair amount of hormones that cause your oil glands to work in overdrive, leaving your face shiny. Both of these things can result in the “pregnancy glow” you have heard of.  If your skin becomes too oily you can use an oil-free cleanser to clean your face. Other than that, do nothing but smile!<h4>Pimple Breakouts and Acne</h4>\n\nIf you have a problem with acne already, **your acne may become more irritated during pregnancy**. The extra hormones in your body cause your oil glands to secrete more oil, which can cause breakouts.  You should keep a strict cleansing routine. You can start with a simple over-the-counter face soap. It is a good idea to use fragrance-free soap to avoid **nausea**.\n\nCleanse your face every night and every morning. Washing your face more than this can cause your skin to become dry.\n\nNext use an astringent to remove any remaining oil. Stay away from any acne medicated astringents; they may contain acne medicine that is not recommended for pregnant women.\n\nFinally, follow this procedure with an oil-free moisturizer.  If you find that you are having problems with acne, consult with your health care provider on acne treatment during pregnancy.<h4>Dry Itchy Skin During Pregnancy</h4>\n\nAs your belly grows, your skin stretches and tightens. This causes very uncomfortable dryness and itching. If you begin to experience severe itching late in your pregnancy, possibly accompanied by **nausea, vomiting**, loss of appetite, **fatigue and/or jaundice**, you should contact your doctor.<h4>Skin Tags</h4>\n\nSkin tags are very small, loose growths of skin that usually appear under your arms or breasts.  After pregnancy, your skin tags may disappear. If they do not disappear, there are ways to remove them."""

Going into preterm labor does not automatically mean that you will have a preterm birth. But preterm labor needs medical attention right away.\n\nPreterm birth is the birth of a baby before 37 weeks. Preterm babies may be born with serious health problems. Some health problems, like cerebral palsy, can be lifelong. Other problems, such as learning disabilities, may appear later in childhood or even in adulthood.<h4>Can preterm labor stop on its own</h4>\n\nIn some cases, yes. For about 3 in 10 women, preterm labor stops on its own. If it does not stop, treatments may be given to try to delay birth. In some cases, these treatments may reduce the risk of complications if the baby is born.<h4>Symptoms and Risk Factors</h4>\n\nPreterm labor contractions lead to changes in the cervix. The changes include effacement (thinning of the cervix) and dilation (opening of the cervix). Signs and symptoms include the following:\n\n•Mild abdominal cramps, with or without diarrhea\n\n•A change in type of vaginal discharge—watery, bloody, or with mucus\n\n•An increase in the amount of discharge\n\n•Pelvic or lower abdominal pressure\n\n•Constant, low, dull backache\n\n•Regular or frequent contractions or uterine tightening, often painless\n\n•Ruptured membranes (your water breaks with a gush or a trickle of fluid)<h4>the risk factors for preterm labor?</h4>\n\nPreterm labor can happen to anyone without warning. But there are some factors that can increase the risk of preterm labor, including:\n\n•preterm birth in a past pregnancy\n\n•having a short cervix early in pregnancy\n\n•past gynecologic conditions or surgeries\n\n•current pregnancy complications\n\n•Younger than 17 or older than 35<h4>Diagnosing Preterm Labor</h4>\n\nPreterm labor is diagnosed when changes in the cervix are found after contractions start. Your ob-gyn may do a pelvic exam to see if your cervix has started to change. You may need to be examined several times over a period of a few hours. Your contractions may also be monitored.\n\nIf you have preterm labor, it is difficult for health care professionals to predict whether you will go on to have preterm birth. The goals of monitoring and treatment are to reduce the risk of preterm birth and protect the health of you and your fetus.<h4>Managing Preterm Labor</h4>\n\nPreterm labor should be managed based on what is best for your health and the fetus's health. If the fetus would benefit from a delay in delivery, medications may be given to:\n\n•help the organs mature more quickly\n\n•reduce the risk of certain complications\n\n•attempt to delay delivery for a short time"""

The placenta develops shortly after conception and attaches to the wall of your uterus.\n\nYour baby is connected to the placenta by the umbilical cord. Together, the placenta and umbilical cord act as your baby's lifeline while in the uterus.\n\nFunctions of the placenta includeProvides your baby with oxygen and nutrients.\n\n•Provides your baby with oxygen and nutrients.\n\n•Provides your baby with oxygen and nutrients.\n\n•Removes harmful waste and carbon dioxide from your baby.\n\n•Produces hormones that help your baby grow.\n\n•Helps protect your baby.<h4>When does the placenta form</h4>\n\nThe placenta begins to form after a fertilized egg implants in your uterus around seven to 10 days after conception. It continues to grow throughout your pregnancy to support your baby. The placenta starts as a few cells and grows to be several inches long.<h4>When does the placenta take over</h4>\n\nThe placenta takes over hormone production by the end of the first trimester (12 weeks of pregnancy). Up until this time, the corpus luteum handles most of the hormone production. Many people's **first-trimester** symptoms of nausea and **fatigue** go away once the placenta takes over in the **second trimester**.<h4>What does the placenta do</h4>\n\nThe placenta helps to keep your baby alive and healthy during pregnancy. Your blood passes through the placenta and provides oxygen, glucose and nutrients to your baby through the umbilical cord. The placenta can also filter out harmful waste and carbon dioxide from your baby's blood. The placenta enables the exchange of oxygen and nutrients between the bloodstreams of you and your baby without ever mixing them. It acts as your baby's lungs, kidneys and liver until birth.\n\nThe placenta produces several important hormones like lactogen, estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy. These pregnancy hormones are beneficial to both you and your baby. For example, the placenta produces a hormone that suppresses milk production during pregnancy.<h4>What does the placenta look like</h4>\n\nThe placenta looks like a disc of bumpy tissue rich in blood vessels, making it appear dark red at term. Most of the mature placental tissue is made up of blood vessels. They connect with the baby through the umbilical cord and branch throughout the placenta disc like the limbs of a tree.<h4>What color is the placenta</h4>\n\nThe placenta has two sides: the side attached to your uterus and the side closest to your baby. The side attached to your uterine wall is a deep reddish blue color, while the side facing your baby is gray.<h4>How big is a normal placenta</h4>\n\nThe placenta is about 10 inches long and 1 inch thick at its center. It weighs around 16 ounces (1 pound) by the time your baby is born.<h4>How is the placenta delivered</h4>\n\nThe placenta is delivered shortly after your baby is born (usually between five and 30 minutes after). This is called the afterbirth or the **third stage** of labor. If you've delivered your baby vaginally, your uterus will continue to contract to expel the placenta. Your healthcare provider may push on your belly or ask you for one final push. If your baby was born via C-section, your healthcare provider removes the placenta through the incision used to deliver your baby. In rare cases, parts of the placenta stay in your uterus after delivery. This can cause bleeding, pain and infection."""

The sac is filled with amniotic fluid. This sac forms about 12 days after getting pregnant. Here’s what the fluid does:Cushions and protects your baby\n\n•Cushions and protects your baby\n\n•Keeps a steady temperature around your baby\n\n•Helps your baby’s lungs grow and develop because your baby breathes in the fluid\n\n•Helps your baby’s digestive system develop because your baby swallows the fluid\n\n•Helps your baby’s muscles and bones develop because your baby can move around in the fluid\n\n•Keeps the umbilical cord (the cord that carries food and oxygen from the placenta to your baby) from being squeezed<h4>How much amniotic fluid should there be</h4>\n\nSometimes you can have too little or too much amniotic fluid. Too little fluid is called oligohydramnios. Too much fluid is called **polyhydramnios**. Either one can cause problems for a pregnant woman and her baby. Even with these conditions, though, most babies are born healthy.<h4>Does the color of amniotic fluid mean anything</h4>\n\nNormal amniotic fluid is clear or tinted yellow. Fluid that looks green or brown usually means that the baby has passed the first bowel movement (meconium) while in the womb. (Usually, the baby has the first bowel movement after birth.)\n\nIf the baby passes meconium in the womb, it can get into the lungs through the amniotic fluid. This can cause serious breathing problems, called meconium aspiration syndrome, especially if the fluid is thick.\n\nSome babies who have been in amniotic fluid that has meconium in it may need treatment right away after birth to prevent breathing problems. Other babies are healthy at birth may not need treatment, even if the amniotic fluid has meconium in it.<h4>Disorders</h4>\n\nSome conditions can cause there to be more or less than the normal amounts of amniotic fluid.\n\nOligohydramnios is when there is too little amniotic fluid.\n\nPolyhydramnios, also referred to as hydramnios or amniotic fluid disorder, is when there is too much fluid.

That can cause slower circulation, leading to swelling and cramping.\n\n•**Sleep on your left side**: This position takes pressure off your liver, which is on the right side of your body and helps improve circulation.\n\n•**Elevate your legs**: Not only does putting your feet up reduce swelling, it also pushes blood flow back to your heart and lungs.\n\n•**Sleep with a pillow between your knees**: This position helps facilitate blood flow through a major vein carrying blood to the heart and back. This position may also relieve stress.\n\n•**Stay active**: If you sit a lot during the day, get up and walk around every couple of hours. Movement helps increase overall blood flow.<h4>Tips to Treat Leg Cramps at Home</h4>\n\n•Massage the cramping muscle and nearby muscle groups to release the tightened muscles to restore proper blood flow, oxygen and nutrients to the muscle.\n\n•Gently hold your leg in a stretched position until the cramp stops. This lengthens your muscle fibers so they can properly contract and tighten, allowing your muscle’s oxygen supply to be restored.\n\n•Rotate applying ice, to ease the pain of the cramp, and heat, to relax your muscle and increase blood flow.<h4>When to See a Doctor</h4>\n\nIf leg cramps are keeping you awake at night and at-home treatments aren't working, **talk with your doctor or midwife**. They can prescribe safe medication to ease the pain and help you sleep.\n\nCall for help right away if you have any of these symptoms:\n\n•Extreme leg pain when you stand upExtreme leg pain when you stand up\n\n•Very swollen legs\n\n•Red spots that are warm to the touch\n\n•Enlarged veins in the legs"""

Up to 4 in 10 people who are pregnant get varicose veins. Varicose veins often start in the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nVaricose veins develop when these one-way valves don't work as well as they should. This means that your blood flows back down your legs and pools in your veins. This stretches the vein walls and causes the veins to swell, twist and bulge. If they become large enough, you can see them under your skin.<h4>Why do I get varicose veins during pregnancy?</h4>\n\nPregnancy increases your chances of developing varicose veins for 3 main reasons:\n\n•Throughout pregnancy, you produce more blood than usual. This increases the pressure in your veins.\n\n•As your baby grows, your uterus gets bigger and presses on the veins that return blood from your legs to your heart.\n\n•Your pregnancy hormones make the walls of your veins softer, and more likely to bulge.\n\nBecause of these effects, varicose veins can develop or get worse during pregnancy. Your risk goes up the older you are and the more full-term pregnancies you’ve had. You’re also more likely to get varicose veins if they run in your family.<h4>Where could I get varicose veins?</h4>\n\nVaricose veins mainly develop in your legs. However, you can also get them in your vulva (the area at the opening of your vagina) or rectum (back passage). Varicose veins of the rectum are also known as **haemorrhoids**.<h4>Are varicose veins painful?</h4>\n\nVaricose veins can cause aches and pains in your legs. Your legs might feel heavy or restless, and they might throb, burn or **cramp**. Some people find varicose veins are not painful and give them no problems.\n\nYou'll probably find that your symptoms are worse later in the day because you've been standing for longer. By the next morning, you'll usually feel better because you've been lying down and the pressure on your veins has eased.<h4>Do varicose veins increase my risk of other health problems?</h4>\n\nIf you have varicose veins, you’re at higher risk of developing a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). If you’re already at risk of DVT for other reasons, you might need treatment to prevent it. You can discuss this with your doctor or midwife.<h4>Can I do anything to prevent varicose veins?</h4>\n\n**Exercise** helps your circulation generally. Specific exercises like calf raises and walking on the spot are good for helping blood flow in your legs.\n\n•do ankle exercises to get your circulation going — bend each foot up and down and rotate it in circles\n\n•shift your weight from foot to foot regularly while you’re standing\n\n•avoid wearing anything tight around your waist or thighs\n\n•put your legs up (for example, on a foot stool or another chair) when you’re resting or sitting."""

                "detail":"""Breast engorgement (also called early postpartum engorgement) is swelling of your breasts that occurs soon after giving birth.\n\nBreast engorgement occurs when the breasts are overfilled with milk and swollen, causing them to feel firm, tender, and painful. This can occur 3 to 5 days after delivering a baby, due to the onset of copious milk production (called primary breast engorgement), or at any time during the postpartum period when milk supply exceeds milk removal (called secondary breast engorgement). Strategies to manage and prevent engorgement are important because this condition increases the risk for breastfeeding problems like mastitis, clogged ducts, latching difficulties, infant feeding refusal, and premature cessation of breastfeeding.<h4>symptoms of breast engorgement?</h4>\n\nWhen the breasts are engorged with milk and swollen, some common signs and symptoms appear in one or (more often) both breasts. The breasts can feel firm, tender, tight, painful, warm, and even lumpy. They will look larger, can be uneven or lopsided, and the skin covering them may appear shiny (due to being stretched) and have more visible veins. The swelling sometimes extends to the armpit or across the sternum and can also affect the nipples, making them firm and flat (or even inverted).[2] Systemically, a mildly elevated body temperature may be present.[3] These signs and symptoms can ebb and flow, remain constant, or progressively worsen with time.[4] It is considered normal to experience some degree of breast engorgement in the first week after giving birth.[5]<h4>How is breast engorgement diagnosed?</h4>\n\nBreast engorgement is a clinical diagnosis that is made based on the presenting signs and symptoms.[6] There is no test or imaging needed to make the diagnosis. If symptoms worsen or a fever develops, it is important to seek medical attention because breast engorgement can precede mastitis, clogged ducts, and other more serious conditions (like a breast abscess).[3]<h4>What are some of the main medical treatments for breast engorgement?</h4>\n\nMost of the treatments for breast engorgement can be done at home and are centered around effective removal of milk through frequent (but not excessive) breastfeeding or pumping with proper technique. Medical management usually isn’t required, especially for self-limiting cases of primary engorgement. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, can be taken at the appropriate dose to reduce symptoms and improve comfort. These medications are safe to take while breastfeeding.[5] Antibiotics are not appropriate for breast engorgement, although they may be used to treat some cases of mastitis.<h4>How could diet affect breast engorgement?</h4>\n\nDiet, including fluid intake, is unlikely to affect breast engorgement, and there are no studies linking diet to the presence or absence of breast engorgement. The volume of milk that a lactating parent produces is primarily driven by the amount of milk that is removed from the breasts,[9] not by the dietary choices of the parent[10].<h4>What causes breast engorgement?</h4>\n\nPrimary breast engorgement is caused by hormonal shifts that cue the production of copious amounts of milk, and these shifts are called lactogenesis II or the second stage of milk production. During this stage, there is a rapid drop in progesterone and a rise in prolactin, cortisol, and insulin, which stimulate breast milk to “come in” and replace colostrum (the “first milk”).[11] This sudden increase in milk production and interstitial fluid volume causes breast swelling and the signs and symptoms of engorgement. When no complications are present and feeding techniques are effective, it is a self-limiting condition that resolves within the first week postpartum as milk production regulates to match infant demand.[1]\n\nSecondary breast engorgement occurs later in the postpartum period when there is a mismatch between milk production and milk removal.[3] There are a wide variety of reasons why this might happen, some related to the lactating parent, some to the infant, and some to both. Examples include a hormonal imbalance in the parent that increases milk production (like hyperthyroidism), pumping too frequently and stimulating excessive milk production, breastfeeding difficulties (like poor latch or positioning), and decreased infant feeding (maybe due to weaning, an infant sickness, or the infant sleeping for longer periods of time at night). Identifying the underlying issue is integral to finding the appropriate treatment."""

For about 3 in 10 women, preterm labor stops on its own. If it does not stop, treatments may be given to try to delay birth. In some cases, these treatments may reduce the risk of complications if the baby is born.<h4>Symptoms and Risk Factors</h4>\n\nPreterm labor contractions lead to changes in the cervix. The changes include effacement (thinning of the cervix) and dilation (opening of the cervix). Signs and symptoms include the following:\n\n•Mild abdominal cramps, with or without diarrhea\n\n•A change in type of vaginal discharge—watery, bloody, or with mucus\n\n•An increase in the amount of discharge\n\n•Pelvic or lower abdominal pressure\n\n•Constant, low, dull backache\n\n•Regular or frequent contractions or uterine tightening, often painless\n\n•Ruptured membranes (your water breaks with a gush or a trickle of fluid)<h4>the risk factors for preterm labor?</h4>\n\nPreterm labor can happen to anyone without warning. But there are some factors that can increase the risk of preterm labor, including:\n\n•preterm birth in a past pregnancy\n\n•having a short cervix early in pregnancy\n\n•past gynecologic conditions or surgeries\n\n•current pregnancy complications\n\n•Younger than 17 or older than 35<h4>Diagnosing Preterm Labor</h4>\n\nPreterm labor is diagnosed when changes in the cervix are found after contractions start. Your ob-gyn may do a pelvic exam to see if your cervix has started to change. You may need to be examined several times over a period of a few hours. Your contractions may also be monitored.\n\nIf you have preterm labor, it is difficult for health care professionals to predict whether you will go on to have preterm birth. The goals of monitoring and treatment are to reduce the risk of preterm birth and protect the health of you and your fetus.<h4>Managing Preterm Labor</h4>\n\nPreterm labor should be managed based on what is best for your health and the fetus's health. If the fetus would benefit from a delay in delivery, medications may be given to:\n\n•help the organs mature more quickly\n\n•reduce the risk of certain complications\n\n•attempt to delay delivery for a short time"""

Birth asphyxia occurs when the baby does not have adequate amounts of oxygen before, during, or after labor. This may have multiple causes, some of which include low oxygen levels in the mother’s blood or reduced blood flow due to compression of the umbilical cord.\n\nAs many have incorrectly used fetal distress and birth asphyxia as interchangeable terms, the Committee on Obstetric Practice of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has expressed concern regarding the use of the two terms. ACOG recommends that the term fetal distress be replaced with “non-reassuring fetal status.”Along with this new term, ACOG further recommends physicians add to the diagnosis a list of additional findings such as fetal tachycardia, bradycardia, repetitive variable decelerations, **low biophysical profile**, and late decelerations. ACOG’s Committee on Obstetric Practice has also stated that the term birth asphyxia should no longer be used as it is too vague of diagnosis for medical use.<h4>Fetal Distress Diagnosis</h4>\n\nIt is important for physicians to monitor the fetus throughout pregnancy to detect any potential complications. One of the more widely used methods of monitoring is electronic fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring.<h4>Conditions Behind Fetal Distress</h4>**Potential precursors to fetal distress or non-reassuring fetal status may include:**\n\nAnemia (the most prevalent obstetric condition seen behind non-reassuring fetal status)\n\nOligohydraminos (a condition in which there is a lower level of amniotic fluid around the fetus)\n\nPregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH)\n\nPost-term pregnancies (42 weeks or more)\n\nIntrauterine Growth Retardation (IUGR)\n\nMeconium-stained amniotic fluid (a condition in which meconium, a baby’s first stool, is present in the amniotic fluid which can block fetal airways)"""

This condition can lead to severe bleeding, depriving the baby of oxygen and essential nutrients while also posing significant risks to the mother. Abruptio placentae typically occurs in the third trimester but can happen earlier in pregnancy as well.\n\nThe exact cause is not always clear, but it is often associated with conditions like high blood pressure, trauma to the abdomen, smoking, drug use, or a history of placental abruption in previous pregnancies. Symptoms may include vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, uterine tenderness, and rapid contractions.\n\n If left untreated, it can result in complications such as premature birth, low birth weight, or even stillbirth. Prompt medical attention is crucial to monitor the condition and determine the best course of treatment, which may include early delivery in severe cases.<h4>What are the main causes of abruptio placentae</h4>\n\nAbruptio placentae, also known as placental abruption, occurs when the placenta partially or completely detaches from the uterus before childbirth. The exact cause of this condition is not always clear, but several factors can contribute to its occurrence. One of the primary causes is trauma or injury to the abdomen, such as from a car accident or a fall, which can lead to premature placental separation.\n\nHigh blood pressure during pregnancy, including conditions like preeclampsia and chronic hypertension, is another major cause, as it affects blood flow to the placenta, increasing the risk of abruption. Additionally, smoking, drug use (especially cocaine), and excessive alcohol consumption can weaken the placenta, making it more prone to detachment.\n\nOther contributing factors include premature rupture of membranes, blood clotting disorders, and a history of previous placental abruption. Understanding these causes can help expectant mothers take preventive measures to minimize their risk and ensure a healthier pregnancy<h4>What are the risk factors associated with abruptio placentae?</h4>\n\nSeveral risk factors can increase the chances of developing abruptio placentae, a serious pregnancy complication where the placenta partially or completely separates from the uterine wall before delivery. One of the major risk factors is high blood pressure, whether it is chronic hypertension or pregnancy-induced conditions like preeclampsia.\n\nOther contributing factors include advanced maternal age (over 35), multiple pregnancies (twins or more), premature rupture of membranes, and uterine abnormalities. Proper prenatal care, avoiding harmful substances, and managing underlying health conditions can help reduce the risk of abruptio placentae and improve pregnancy outcomes.<h4>What are the symptoms of abruptio placentae?</h4>Abruptio placentae is a serious pregnancy complication in which the placenta partially or completely separates from the uterus before childbirth. This condition can lead to significant risks for both the mother and baby. The symptoms of abruptio placentae can vary depending on the severity of the separation but often include **sudden abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and uterine tenderness**. The bleeding may be light or heavy, and in some cases, there may not be visible bleeding if the blood is trapped behind the placenta. Other signs include **lower back pain, frequent contractions, and a feeling of tightness in the uterus**. """

Some possible symptoms include:\n\n•excessive vaginal bleeding\n\n•sudden pain between contractions\n\n•contractions that become slower or less intense\n\n•abnormal abdominal pain or soreness\n\n•recession of the baby’s head into the birth canal\n\n•bulging under the pubic bone\n\n•sudden pain at the site of a previous uterine scar\n\n•loss of uterine muscle tone\n\n•rapid heart rate, low blood pressure, and shock in the mother\n\n•abnormal heart rate in the baby\n\n•failure of labor to progress naturally<h4>What causes uterine rupture?</h4>During labor, pressure builds as the baby moves through the mother’s birth canal. This pressure can cause the mother’s uterus to tear. Often, it tears along the site of a previous cesarean delivery scar. When a uterine rupture occurs, the uterus’s contents — including the baby — may spill into the mother’s abdomen.<h4>What are the risks of uterine rupture</h4>\n\nA uterine rupture can be a life-threatening complication of childbirth for both the mother and the baby.\n\nIn the mother, uterine ruptures can cause major blood loss, or hemorrhage. However, fatal bleeding due to uterine rupture is rare when it occurs in a hospital.\n\nUterine ruptures are usually a much greater health concern for the baby. Once doctors diagnose a uterine rupture, they must act quickly to pull the baby from the mother. If the baby isn’t delivered within 10 to 40 minutes, it will die from a lack of oxygen.<h4>How is uterine rupture diagnosed?</h4>\n\nUterine rupture happens suddenly and can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are often nonspecific. If doctors suspect uterine rupture, they’ll look for signs of a baby’s distress, such as a slow heart rate. Doctors can only make an official diagnosis during surgery.<h4>How is uterine rupture treated?</h4>\n\nIf a uterine rupture causes major blood loss, surgeons may need to remove a woman’s uterus to control her bleeding. After this procedure, a woman can no longer become pregnant. Women with excessive blood loss receive blood transfusions.\n\nAlso, surgery is usually required to pull the baby from the mother’s body. Doctors will improve the baby’s chances of survival by administering critical care, such as oxygen.<h4>What is the outlook of uterine rupture</h4>\n\nAbout **6 percent of babies** don’t survive their mothers’ uterine ruptures. And only about **1 percent** of mothers die from the complication. The more quickly a uterine rupture is diagnosed and the mother and baby are treated, the greater their chances of survival.<h4>Can uterine rupture be prevented?</h4>\n\nThe only way to prevent uterine rupture is to have a cesarean delivery. It can’t be fully prevented during vaginal birth.\n\nA uterine rupture shouldn’t stop you from choosing vaginal birth. However, it’s important to discuss all of your options with your doctor so that you make the best decision for you and your baby. Make sure your doctor is familiar with your medical history, and is aware of any previous births by cesarean delivery or surgeries on your uterus."""

                "detail":"""Postpregnancy hemorrhage is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and can be the result of subinvolution of the placental site or retained or residual products of conception, and enhanced myometrial vascularity, which may be physiologic or associated with these causes, should not be confused with arteriovenous malformations or other vascular anomalies.\n\nSecondary postpregnancy hemorrhage (PPH) is increasing in incidence, especially in developed countries such as the United States. PPH occurs after 24 hours and up to 12 weeks in the postpregnancy period and may be associated with significant maternal morbidity. Common causes of secondary PPH are subinvolution of the placental site (SIPS) and retained or residual products of conception (RPOC). Other less common and rare causes include bleeding diathesis, endo(myo)metritis, gestational trophoblastic disease, and vascular anomalies such as congenital arteriovenous malformation (AVM), iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula, or pseudoaneurysm. A common finding encountered during imaging evaluation of secondary PPH is increased vascularity in the myometrium deep to an implantation site, termed enhanced myometrial vascularity (EMV). EMV typically represents the physiologic reversion of the uterus back to its prepregnancy state. The appearance of EMV varies from mild to marked and is also associated with SIPS and RPOC. Interpretation or reporting of EMV as an AVM or other rare uterine vascular anomaly may lead to unnecessary testing and overtreatment. The authors review placental physiology, describe the causes of secondary PPH and their imaging appearances, and present an algorithm to assist the radiologist in diagnosis of this important condition and management options.\n\nPostpartum hemorrhage (also called PPH) is when a woman has heavy bleeding after giving birth. It’s a serious but rare condition. It usually happens within 1 day of giving birth, but it can happen up to 12 weeks after having a baby. About 1 to 5 in 100 women who have a baby (1 to 5 percent) have PPH.\n\nIt’s normal to lose some blood after giving birth. Women usually lose about half a quart (500 milliliters) during vaginal birth or about 1 quart (1,000 milliliters) after a Cesarean birth (also called c-section).\n\nA c-section is surgery in which your baby is born through a cut that your doctor makes in your belly and uterus (womb). With PPH, you can lose much more blood, which is what makes it a dangerous condition. PPH can cause a severe drop in blood pressure. If not treated quickly, this can lead to shock and death. Shock is when your body organs don’t get enough blood flow.<h4>When does PPH happen?</h4>\n\nAfter your baby is delivered, the uterus normally contracts to push out the placenta.  The contractions then help put pressure on bleeding vessels where the placenta was attached in your uterus.  The placenta grows in your uterus and supplies the baby with food and oxygen through the umbilical cord. If the contractions are not strong enough, the vessels bleed more.  It can also happen if small pieces of the placenta stay attached. <h4>How do you know if you have PPH</h4>\n\n•Heavy bleeding from the vagina that doesn’t slow or stop\n\n•Drop in blood pressure or signs of shock.\n\n•Signs of low blood pressure and shock include blurry vision; having chills, clammy skin or a really fast heartbeat; feeling confused, dizzy, sleepy or weak; or feeling like you’re going to faint.\n\n•Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) or throwing up\n\n•Swelling and pain around the vagina or perineum. The perineum is the area between the vagina and rectum.<h4>Are some women more likely than others to have PPH?</h4>\n\nThings that make you more likely than others to have PPH are called risk factors. Having a risk factor doesn’t mean for sure that you will have PPH, but it may increase your chances. PPH usually happens without warning. But talk to your health care provider about what you can do to help reduce your risk for having PPH.\n\nYou’re more likely than other women to have PPH if you’ve had it before. This is called having a history of PPH. Asian and Hispanic women also are more likely than others to have PPH."""
